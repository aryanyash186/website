        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War">armed conflict</a>

        ended on 16 December 1971 when the military forces of West Pakistan that were in Bangladesh <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistani_Instrument_of_Surrender">surrendered</a> in what

        Bengali <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Bengali_refugees#1970s">refugees</a> fled to neighbouring

        Pakistan Navy. The nascent <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladesh_Air_Force">Bangladesh Air Force</a>
        flew <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sortie">sorties</a> against Pakistani military bases. By November,
        the
        Bangladesh forces restricted the Pakistani military to its barracks during the night. They secured control
        of
        most parts of the countryside. <sup>[24]</sup><br><br>

    <h2>Background</h2>

    <img src="military symbols of March71.png" alt="">

    <p>Prior to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partition_of_India">Partition of British India</a>, the
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lahore_Resolution">Lahore Resolution</a> initially envisaged separate
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslims">Muslim</a> -majority
        states in the eastern and northwestern zones of British India. A proposal for an independent <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Bengal">United
            Bengal</a>
        was mooted by Prime Minister <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huseyn_Shaheed_Suhrawardy">Huseyn Shaheed
            Suhrawardy</a> in 1946, but was opposed by the colonial
        authorities.
        The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Pakistan_Renaissance_Society">East Pakistan Renaissance
            Society</a> advocated the creation of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sovereign_state">sovereign
            state</a>
        in eastern British
        India. <sup>[25]</sup><br><br>

        Political negotiations led, in August 1947, to the official birth of two states, <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan">Pakistan</a> and
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India">India</a>,<sup>[26]</sup>
        giving presumably permanent homes for Muslims and Hindus respectively following the departure of the
        British. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominion_of_Pakistan">Dominion of Pakistan</a> comprised two
        geographically and culturally separate areas to
        the east and
        the west with India in between. <sup>[25]</sup><br><br>

        The western zone was popularly (and for a period, also officially) termed West Pakistan and the eastern zone
        (modern-day Bangladesh) was initially termed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominion_of_Pakistan">East
            Bengal</a> and later, East Pakistan. Although the
        population
        of the two zones was close to equal, political power was concentrated in West Pakistan and it was widely
        perceived that East Pakistan was being exploited economically, leading to many grievances. Administration of
        two discontinuous territories was also seen as a challenge. <sup>[27]</sup><br><br>

        On 25 March 1971, after an election won by an East Pakistani political party (the <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Awami_League">Awami League</a> )
        was ignored
        by the ruling (West Pakistani) establishment, rising political discontent and <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nationalism#Cultural_nationalism">cultural
            nationalism</a> in East
        Pakistan was met by brutal <sup>[28]</sup> and suppressive force from the ruling elite of the West Pakistan
        establishment, in what came to be termed as <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Searchlight">Operation Searchlight</a>. <sup>[29]</sup> The
        violent
        crackdown by the
        Pakistan
        Army <sup>[30]</sup> led to Awami League leader <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheikh_Mujibur_Rahman">Sheikh Mujibur Rahman</a> declaring East
        Pakistan's
        independence as
        the
        state of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladesh">Bangladesh</a> on 26 March 1971. <sup>[31]</sup>
        Most Bengalis supported this move although
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamism">Islamists</a> and
        Biharis
        opposed this and sided with the Pakistan Army instead. <sup>[32]</sup><br><br>

        Pakistani President <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahya_Khan">Agha Muhammad Yahya Khan</a> ordered the
        Pakistani military to restore the
        Pakistani
        government's authority, beginning the civil war. <sup>[31]</sup> The war led to a substantial number of refugees
        (estimated at the time to be about 10 million) <sup>[33][34]</sup> flooding into the <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_India">eastern
            provinces of India</a>.
        <sup>[35]</sup>
        Facing a mounting humanitarian and economic crisis, India started actively aiding and organising the
        Bangladeshi resistance army known as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mukti_Bahini">Mukti Bahini</a>.

    <h3>Language controversy</h3>

    <img src="Sectors of Bangladesh Liberation War.png" alt="">

    <h4 class="ffff">Main article: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bengali_language_movement">Bengali language
            movement</a></h4>

    <p>In 1948, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor-General_of_Pakistan">Governor-General</a> <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammad_Ali_Jinnah">Muhammad Ali Jinnah</a> declared that "<a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urdu">Urdu</a>,
        and only Urdu" would be the federal
        language of Pakistan. <sup>[36][37]</sup> However, Urdu was historically prevalent only in the north, central,
        and
        western region of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_subcontinent">subcontinent</a>; whereas in
        East Bengal, the native language was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bengali_language">Bengali</a>, one
        of the two
        most easterly branches of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indo-European_languages">Indo-European
            languages</a>. <sup>[38]</sup> The Bengali-speaking
        people of Pakistan
        constituted over 56% of the country's population. <sup>[39][40]</sup><br><br>

        The government stand was widely viewed as an attempt to suppress the culture of the eastern wing. The people
        of East Bengal demanded that their language be given federal status alongside Urdu and English. The <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bengali_language_movement">Language
            Movement</a> began in 1948, as civil society protested the removal of the <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bengali_alphabet">Bengali script</a> from
        currency and
        stamps, which were in place since the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Raj">British Raj</a>.
        <sup>[41]</sup><br><br>

        The movement reached its climax in 1952, when on 21 February, the police fired on protesting students and
        civilians, causing several deaths. The day is revered in Bangladesh as the <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_Movement_Day">Language Movement Day</a>.
        Later, in
        memory of the deaths in 1952, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNESCO">UNESCO</a> declared 21 February as
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Mother_Language_Day">International Mother
            Language Day</a> in November
        1999. <sup>[41]</sup>
